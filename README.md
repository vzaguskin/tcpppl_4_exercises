# Exercises for Bjarne Stroustrup: The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition) in C++ 11x

Implemented basically to familiarize myself with c++11 and later with no intention for creating perfect or ideal implementation. There may be some absolutely unnescessary template metaprogramming used just for fun. Some of the excercises can be skipped because I've found them boring or just didn't have enough free time.

Files should be compiled with std=c++11 switch for g++. Some of them may require C++14 or even 17 and g++ version 5.
